While the band tips its hat to the New Wave, Ska, and Rock movements of the early 80s, the sound has synthesized into a unique cacophony of pop creativity that constantly catches folks off guard. </P><P>&#8220;We really admire bands like the Talking Heads, Prince, and the English Beat for their approach to song craft,&#8221; explains Slippery alumnus Phil Aaronson. &#8220;Those artists came along during a time period when music was created either to conform to universally accepted standards of what Pop Radio sounded like, or to throw those conventions to the wind.  While those bands broke the mold, so to speak, they also redefined what popular music could be&#151;and those echoes are still felt to this day.&#8221;</P><P>Slippery People has taken the best elements of their influences&#151;analog synths, electronic percussion, and round acoustic drums, as well as horns, jangly guitars and monstrously percussive bass&#151;to creative the sonic stew they have entitled, &#8220;<A HREF="music.html">CAUTION: SLIPPERY PEOPLE</A>.&#8221; The album serves as both a Red Level alert, as well as a clean shot across the bow of San&#160;Francisco's rutted alternative scene.</P><P>&#8220;At the end of the day, we are a pop band, and we give the people what they want,&#8221; continues Phil. &#8220;When you see the Slippery People perform, there is an element of, 'What is this all about?'  We're not shoe gazers. In fact, we are quite the opposite&#151;dramatic and ecstatic.  We've seen the most jaded scenesters start to dance at our shows, only to catch themselves as if to say, 'Is this real or ironic?'&#8221;</P><P>Phil then emphatically adds, &#8220;Trust me&#151;this is real!&#8221;</P><P>Over the last four years Slippery People has played such clubs as The Red Devil Lounge and Tongue and Groove, to name a few, culminating in their CD release party at the Tongue and Groove on November 4th, played to a packed house. Says synth and sax extraordinaire Mark Yee (paraphrasing the band's former singer and founder Bill Donte), &#8220;We really felt wrapped up in the love of the audience. I felt like a warm burrito.&#8221;</P></TD><!--sidebar cell--><TD CLASS="sidebar" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><H2>Bios</H2><P>Learn more <A HREF="bio.html">about</A> the members, both past and present, of Slippery People.
