Our next move was to start an airband. We did a whole &quot;The Time&quot; set. A local TV network held a contest that decided we had the &quot;Bay Area's Best Airband&quot;, for our seven minute rendition of &quot;The Bird&quot;. There was money and a TV segment. Anyway, for the mid eighties, that was big time. My best friend was a dead ringer for Morris Day and I played Jesse Johnson. I wasn't black, but I did have a pink suit and matching pink guitar.</P><P>We eventually started to make our own music. Like many of us who were young and followed the Mineappolis sound, the music was heavy on beat, sex, and egocentricity. Even today, I find it hard to shake those prominant themes from my teen years. But as it happens to most of us, those early relationships broke down as we all had to get real with college and life and all that shit.</P><P>After college my musical interests changed to dancing. I became a professional dancer. I spent the last twelve years competing in ballroom and latin dancing, choreographing for movies, TV and videos. I have even been a featured dancer in some TV commercials and motion pictures including &quot;Dance With Me&quot; and the newly released &quot;RENT&quot;. I was dancing to music for a living but not making music at all.</P><P>I hadn't touched a guitar or written a tune for thirteen years, when a year and a half ago my brother's band, Slippery People, needed another guitar player and backup singer to help add depth to some of the tunes. The first night in auditions I couldn't find a clean G chord had my life depended on it. After scratching out some pretty pitchy vocals, they decided to keep me around to help keep down the cost of the rehearsal space.</P><P>As time has gone on, the volume on my mic has slowly gone up and happily enough I regained enough form on the guitar to write some new material for the band's stage show. I have seen the growth of this band explode in the last year. It now seems like a space where musical magic can really happen. Also, the commitment of the band to bring an entertaining stage show to the people gives me a place and opportunity to express myself more fully than I had ever originally thought possible.</P></TD><!--sidebar--><TD CLASS="sidebar" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><H2>Bios</H2><P>Learn more <A HREF="bio.html">about</A> the members, both past and present, of Slippery People.
