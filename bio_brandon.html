In fourth grade, I wanted to play the drums, but my parents thought they'd be too loud; so I started taking Suzuki-method violin classes after school. I did just fine, but after one of the recitals, the teacher told them that I had aptitude on the violin, but that they should think about letting me play&#8230; drums. Soon after, I stopped playing violin. After later elementary-school forays into lip-syncing KISS songs at talent shows (with fake guitars we made ourselves!) and other youthful indiscretions, I finally got a chance to play the drums in high school. My friend&#8217;s mom, who was a music teacher, had an old drumset that I borrowed for a couple of months when we tried to start a band. At one point, my dad apologized to me. He said, &#8220;They&#8217;re really not that loud. If we&#8217;d known, we would have let you play drums when you were a kid.&#8221; No hard feelings, Dad.</p><p>I finally started seriously tackling music the summer between high school and college. I got my first guitar, and as soon as I could play a few chords, I was writing songs. Not very good songs, but unlike most people who pick up the guitar and start learning other people&#8217;s stuff, the only thing that occurred to me was to make up my own. At college, I started my first real band, for which I wrote most of the songs, and the hook was set. Since then, I&#8217;ve sung, played guitar, played drums, and played bass in various solo and band projects, from St.&#160;Louis to Austin, and now in San&#160;Francisco.</p><p>And I have no idea who Bill Donte is.</p></TD><!--sidebar--><TD CLASS="sidebar" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC"><H2>Bios</H2><P>Learn more <A HREF="bio.html">about</A> the members, both past and present, of Slippery People.
