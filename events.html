Emergenza just can't get enough of us.

We will be in the Saturday June 10th lineup, but don't look for any announcements from the band: we don't want to give Emergen$a any more hard earned dough. (Ask Phil for details!)

We partied to a packed house. We played until our fingers bled and were glad to do it. Many love connections were made that night thanks to our dulcet tones, and one of the patrons is going to name their first born &quot;Slippery People Brownstone&quot; (Mike for short). CDs flew off the shelves causing a mini-stampede which could only be quelled by Alex and Dave singing &quot;I Got You, Babe&quot; unplugged. Ho, Ho, ho the humanity.</P></TD><!--sidebar--><TD CLASS="sidebar" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><P>Thank you, Slippery fans for all the love over the years!
